# Frequently Asked Questions

**What is shemite-genome-reclamation?**  
A project led by House of David to expose E-M329 suppression (CTS6773, M3987, Y471213), linking Israelite-Nubian-Egyptian royals to 10â€“15% African-American Y-chromosomes, driving reparations.

**How can I contribute?**  
Log suppressed SNPs in data/suppression_evidence.csv, develop t-SNE scripts in viz/, or validate BAMs (I10145, JK2134) in src/. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Why blockchain?**  
IPFS (QmY789) and Arweave (abc123) ensure immutable evidence of suppression.

**How do I report a suppressed SNP?**  
Use the [Report Suppressed SNP issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report_suppressed_snp.md) to log findings (e.g., CTS6773 in I10145 BAM). Include source, tools, and DCO sign-off. Verified reports are added to data/suppression_evidence.csv.
